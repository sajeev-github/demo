Virtual graph mapping is the machnishm with which business users can connect their data with knowledge models to get more insights. We have seen how mapping can be done using code and wtih UI assisted tools. AI suggested mapping further simplifies the mapping process by undersnding the relation between the underlying data source and the knowledge models and providing suggestions for the business users. 

Tool we are going to showcase today is Stardog Designer, which is a Web based visual mapping tool, which provides auto suggestions for the business users to help with the mappings. Tool supports complex queries and allow collaboration between teams.

In the showcase we will walkyou throught the ESG usecase which we showcased in last review, and this time will take do the mapping using Stardog desinger and show how the auto suggest featuer works.

==================

Quering or exploring throguh knowledge graphs was always a challenge when it comes to the usage of semantic web technologies. Learning a new query language and the lack of user friendly tools were the challenge infront of the knowledge engineers and business users. 

Next tool we are going to introduce is Stardog Explorer which is a web based tool to exoplorer the knowledge graphs. We will see how we can use the tool to navigate through our ESG use case. Which activities are aligned and not aligned.

========================

Integrating OrgIntel with knowledge graphs was another challenge we tried to resolve in TDF. By bringing OrgIntel capabilities like entity verification and enrichment to knowledge graphs endusers can get a 360 view of customer data.

For this demo we are using two differnt datasets which can be logically connected by technically impossible due to differnce in schema and data. We are going to OrgIntel entitiy verification API enrich and connect these two datasets and comeup with a better business view. 

By bringing in OrgIntel integraion into GSL business users can get a 360 customer view of their disperse data.

========================

Semantic search means unserstand users search intend and get the result instad of find the mached keywords. Also should consider the user context (Profile data or search histroy also into account). 

For this demo we create a virtual knowledge graph for a list of companies and executives. How a end user can use natual language to get the data out of the knowledge graph.
